# easyshare &mdash; one click image sharing

### Motivation

As file-sharing platforms mature, they need to integrate additional features such as editing, the ability to browse other users' images, and sometimes require creation of an account. easyshare is a retro-prototype of a drag 'n' drop + share link image hosting service with the additional perk of pretty, unique URLs.

### Usage

1.  Navigate to [easyshare.vishalshangari.com](https://easyshare.vishalshangari.com/)
2.  Upload an image!

### Design

- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js (Express)
- Database: Google Cloud Firestore
- Storage: AWS S3

### Note

As this is just a rapid prototype, please note that all images are publicly accessibly by default and by intent. Please be careful what you upload!
